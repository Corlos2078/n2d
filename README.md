# Node2Deauther 2021
Node2Deauther (N2D) is an easy to use ESP8266 flash utility which provides automatic device detection and driver installation for compatible ESP8266 devices such as the NodeMCU and the D1 Mini.

#### UPDATE: The project's development has been suspended due to build / hardware issues. In order to publish a decent application and not some quick, bodge - I have decided to suspend development until problems can be resolved, i.e. a new rig.
